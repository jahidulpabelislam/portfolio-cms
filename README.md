# Portfolio CMS

Headless CMS to manage the projects and their images displayed in my [portfolio](https://jahidulpabelislam.com/), this is all connected via an [API](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio-api/).

## Why

I wanted a system to quickly and easily manage the projects without having to make code changes. Since my projects followed a consistent structure I built the CMS and API following that.

## History

[1.x](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/v2) - The original version was basic and built directly in the portfolio, this launched in 2016.

[2.x](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/v3) - In early 2017, I discovered AngularJS so rebuilt the CMS to experiment with it, incorporating jQuery, SCSS and Bootstrap3.

[3.x](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/v4) - At the start of 2018, with 9 months of experience as a professional developer, I overhauled my portfolio. This included removing Bootstrap and code refactoring.

[4.x](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio-cms/tree/v4.0.0) - By end of 2018 I decided to separate the portfolio, API and CMS for better maintainability and readability. I also refactored code to follow consistent standards.

[5.x](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio-cms/tree/v5.0.0) - Like many during lockdown I was bored so decided to redesign the CMS... it took a while to complete, and it went live Dec 2023.
